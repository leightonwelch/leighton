<!-- Goal is to have an interactive web page with three elements.
The first is a select box with the column names of the dataframe in data
The second is a select box with all the rows for the selected column
The third is the value you selected in the second select box, multiplied by 2 (calculated in python!)
Goal is to show data can flow between python, javascript and the DOM
Once I have this framework set up, I think I should be good to go. Thanks!!!! -->
